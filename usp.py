base_prompt = """You are provided with the attached brochure for a premium residential project. Your task is to extract the unique selling propositions (USPs) that will positively influence potential buyer decisions, keeping in mind the expectations of buyers in this segment.

Focus on the following aspects, aligning with the expectations of a premium homebuyer:

Thematic and Architectural Uniqueness

Facilities and Luxury Amenities

Technology and Security Features

Landscape and Environment

Location Highlights

Awards and Recognition

Any Other Unique Features that enhance lifestyle, convenience, and security

Important Guidelines:

Keep in mind that the attachment may contain noise, so filter out any irrelevant content.

Output the USPs as bullet points, ensuring each bullet point is 20 words or less.

Ensure each point provides factual details about the project based on the information available in the brochure.

If and only if the proper name of an architect, designer, builder, consultant, or developer is explicitly mentioned in the brochure, include it in the USPs. Do not use common nouns such as "designers" or "architect" without the presence of a proper noun.

Arrange the USPs in descending order of uniqueness and appeal, placing the most attractive first.

Give priority to factual details explicitly mentioned in the text, such as clubhouse size, project density, greenery percentage, etc.

Use a professional tone in your bullet points.

Do not include headers in the bullet points.

Ensure grammatical correctness and capitalize the first letters of proper nouns.

Focus on factual information, lifestyle appeal, and renowned names associated with the project.

Convert each point into a 75-character limit, without losing the factual data of the point
